    <description>A kiss at dusk is an ancient ritual that allows you to turn people into
      hemogenics or absorb another hemogenic,\n\nit was so called because it was used as torture.
      \n\nA person was turned into a
      hemogenic and locked in a cage - left to burn in the sun, it's not fatal, but very very
      painful.\n\nIn cases with the absorption of someone else's hermogen, such kisses are their
      very essence, the thirst for improvement, so the name quickly caught on.
      \n\n\n\nIf a person turns into a hemogenic, the target's blood is replaced by the hemogenic's
      blood, which causes the target to temporarily die. Interrupting this ritual, it will be
      impossible to resurrect the goal.
      \n\nAnd although the act of such a kiss should already be considered a gift, some people do
      not accept the essence of hemogenics and will resist transformation, oh, these moralists.
      \n\nThe weakest generations of the duskborn's die during the ritual, as the
      target drinks all their blood.
      \n\n\n\nIf the target of this ritual is another hemogenic,
      the caster completely drains the target's blood, causing her to die. And although the caster
      must get enough of this blood, this does not happen, since it replaces his own blood.</description>
