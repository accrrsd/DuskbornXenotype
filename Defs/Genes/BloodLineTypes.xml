    <description>There was a planet with ideal climatic conditions on which the life of creatures who accidentally got there flourished, but one day the Archotek noticed an interesting signature of living beings living in ideal conditions and decided to conduct an experiment by changing the composition of the atmosphere, which caused eternal twilight, but this was not enough, the archotek divided the creatures into their habitat and began to conduct experiments.\n\nAfter conducting experiments, carriers of the "Hemogenic" gene became the dominant species on the planet, which endowed the user with a need for blood, along with divergent abilities.\n\nLater, the code of the gene was transmitted by the archotech to the central computer and left the planet, but the Hemogenics became the top of the food chain and were able to survive and develop a mutation that changed the main gene "Hemogenic" so much that the gene became very different from the one that was fixed by the Archotech. The mutation gene began to be called the "Duskborn" gene in honor of the planet of origin.</description>
