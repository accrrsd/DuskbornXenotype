    <description>There was a planet with ideal climatic conditions on which the life of creatures
      who accidentally got there flourished, but one day the Archotek noticed an interesting
      signature of living beings living in ideal conditions and decided to conduct an experiment by
      changing the composition of the atmosphere, which caused eternal twilight, but this was not
      enough, the archotek divided the creatures into their habitat and began to conduct
      experiments.\n\nAfter conducting experiments, carriers of the "Hemogenic" gene became the
      dominant species on the planet, which endowed the user with a need for blood, along with
      divergent abilities.\n\nLater, the code of the gene was transmitted by the archotech to the
      central computer and left the planet, but the Hemogenics became the top of the food chain and
      were able to survive and develop a mutation that changed the main gene "Hemogenic" so much
      that the gene became very different from the one that was fixed by the Archotech. The mutation
      gene began to be called the "Duskborn" gene in honor of the planet of origin.</description>
