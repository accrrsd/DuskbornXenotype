# Duskborn.

There was a planet with ideal climatic conditions on which the life of creatures who accidentally got there flourished, but one day the Archotech noticed an interesting signature of living beings in ideal living conditions
and decided to conduct an experiment by changing the composition of the atmosphere, which caused eternal twilight, but this was not enough, the archotech divided the creatures into their habitat and began to conduct experiments.

After conducting experiments, carriers of the "Hemogenic" gene became the dominant species on the planet, which endowed the user with a need for blood, along with divergent abilities.

Later, the code of the gene was transmitted by the archotech to the central computer and left the planet, but the Hemogenics, due to the fact that they were the tip of the food chain, were able to survive and develop to a state distinguishable from that which was recorded by the Archotech.

After a while, three branches of the genotype were formed with their own unique mutations. Each of them, however, lived in unique climatic conditions.

Briefly about genotypes:

- Ventrue - Mind control
- Tremere - Blood control
- Hecata - Death control

\*\*The mod is dedicated to increasing the number of hemogenic abilities, developing powers and making the hemogenic path a good alternative to psi-force.

## Genotypes:

### Ventrue

Ventrue lived in an endless desert, having found a number of oases in it, Ventrue erected settlements around them, attracting the rest of the inhabitants of the desert, soon a war broke out between them and the Ventrue realized that the best weapon was a Mirage.

Following the mirage, they learned to distinguish illusion from reality and becoming like the force of nature, Ventrue mastered the techniques of influencing perception, deftly deceiving their opponents, Ventrue giggled viciously while
their enemies cut each other.

Dividing and dominating the Ventrue soon seized power over all the empty cities and went on, sending agents around the world, soon the Ventrue controlled all the adjacent states from the shadows.

During the war with the empire, the Ventrue became addicted to blue blood, compared to its taste, the rest of the blood is comparable to slops.

### Tremere

Tremere lived in the north in peace and tranquility, due to the absence of dangers other than natural temperatures, Tremere began to build settlements and develop science, in the study of the world and themselves, especially after
what the Archotech did to them, Tremor learned to control their own and other people's blood. Over time, they also gained resistance to cold temperatures.

Due to the great wealth of the region and the calm atmosphere, other hemogenics clans began to come to the place of residence of the Trimmers, because of their unpreparedness for war, the Tremere decisively lost and were forced to leave
to less favorable regions

In the war with the empire, the Tremere fought the best, inflicting massive blood attacks and tearing the hearts of opponents, they terrified the Imperial legions.

### Hecata

Hecata lived in a toxic swamp, every death there meant the beginning of a new life, and every life was a foreshadowing of a new death, there were no rich and poor in the swamps, mostly the dead.

Hecata imitating natural Detritophages learned to survive in such conditions, absorbing hemogen from corpses, fighting with poisonous creatures and inhaling disgusting fumes, they gained immunity to poison.

Having been fed with rot, they learned to control the blood in dead bodies, began to transform under the influence of the habitat, they themselves learned to release toxins. The same environment disfigured them.

In the war with the empire, Hecata was the best of all, due to its unique and very difficult climate, as well as the ability to lift the bodies of the Imperials, they fought with the enemy with his own people and suffered almost no losses

## War against the Empire

Once an Empire flotilla wandered onto the planet, and seeing that hemogenics also have unusual abilities, the empire considered this a sacrilege and unleashed a war.

The war went on for a long time, but the fleet, even with an advantage in quantity and technology, could not eradicate the infection, they only suffered losses. Finally, it was decided not to lose the ladies and gentlemen of the blue blood and the Commander gave the order to bombard the planet.

During the operation, the original hemogenics died, but their infection managed to spread in the fleet, which spread it throughout space.

## Abilities

Abilities are being actively developed and it's too early to talk about anything specific. Unless it is assumed that there will be about 8 of them per genotype. 5 active and 3 passive. Which in total will give 24 abilities.
