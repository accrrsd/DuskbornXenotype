	<description>This mod is inspired by the idea of technical vampirism by "hemogens" and Vampire the Masquerade. \n\nAdds several "genera" of hemogenics, each of which has its own characteristic abilities, improves the vanilla concept of hemogenics and, in general, makes the game just more interesting, without going very far from the vanilla idea of genetics.</description>
